## About
The most common way of connecting to a remote Linux server is through SSH. SSH stands for Secure Shell and provides a safe and secure way of executing commands, making changes, and configuring services remotely. When you connect through SSH, you log in using an account that exists on the remote server.

The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. SSH applications are based on a clientâ€“server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server.

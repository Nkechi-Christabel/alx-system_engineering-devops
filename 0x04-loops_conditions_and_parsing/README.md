# Loops, conditions and parsing
<strong>Loops</strong> are a programming construct which allow us to repeat a command or set
of commands for each item in a list. Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also
reduces the amount of typing required (and hence reduces the number of typing mistakes).

## Learning objectives

- How to create SSH keys
- What is the advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env` bash over `#!/bin/bash`
- How to use `while`, `until` and `for` loops
- How to use `if`, `else`, `elif` and case condition statements
- How to use the `cut` command
- What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- You are not allowed to use `awk`
- Your Bash script must pass `Shellcheck` (version 0.7.0) without any error
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script doing

## Concepts

- `env`
- `cut`
